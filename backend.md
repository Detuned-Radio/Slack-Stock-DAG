# Backend Development

## Getting started

1. Start with Django. Complete the tutorial on Django Girls (the blog app).
2. Get good at modelling data with databases. I recommend doing this with a project. Check this [repo](https://github.com/dush-t/dvm-assignments) out for comprehensive projects in Django - (make sure you read up about best practices for implementing data models while you're doing the assignment and not before it.)
3. Make something interesting with what you learnt.
4. Learn how to implement JSON APIs in Django and how to use them with front end (your front end knowledge might help here).
5. Make something using a JSON API.
6. At this point you'll know enough Django to make pretty much whatever you want. Its up to you if you wanna stick with it. I'd recommend abandoning it for a while and trying out a different framework (I'd recommend trying node + express - it'll give you exposure to NoSQL databases and out-of-the-browser javascript.).
7. If you did point 6, you'll know what to learn next based on your own experience.
