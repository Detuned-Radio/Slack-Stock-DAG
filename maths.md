### Advanced

- \[video\] Why use measure theory for probability?:
Measure-theoretic language is widespread in many advanced texts on probability.
If you're unable to appreciate its utility, watch this 3-part video:
[part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjPXfUT7Odo),
[part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9KOeP-nrYQ),
[part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAYA2Mu51bw).
Then read a bit about [Lebesgue integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDNDTOVnKJk),
which helps give a rigorous and general
[definition of 'expected value'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value#General_case).
